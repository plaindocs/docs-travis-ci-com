### What this guide covers

This guide covers build environment and configuration topics specific to C#, F#, and Visual Basic
projects. Please make sure to read our [Getting started](/user/getting-started/)
and [general build configuration](/user/customizing-the-build/) guides first.

### Beta Warning

Travis CI support for C#, F#, and Visual Basic is currently in beta and may be removed or altered at any time.
If you run into any problems, please report them in the [Travis CI issue tracker](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/new)
and cc @joshua-anderson @akoeplinger @nterry.

### Build Environment

Currently, Travis builds your C#, F#, and Visual Basic project with the latest version of the [Mono runtime](http://www.mono-project.com/) on Linux.
It is based on the ECMA C# and CLR standards but might not be a perfect replacement for the Microsoft .NET Framework.

### Overview

The setup for C#, F#, and Visual Basic projects looks like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: csharp
solution: solution-name.sln
{% endhighlight %}

When the `solution` key is present, Travis will run NuGet package restore and build the given solution. You can also specify your own scripts, as shown in the next section.

### Script

By default Travis will run `xbuild /p:Configuration=Release solution-name.sln`. Xbuild is a build tool designed to be an implementation for Microsoft's MSBuild (the tool that Visual Studio uses to build your projects).
To override this, you can set the `script` attribute like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: csharp
solution: solution-name.sln
script:    # the following commands are just examples, use whatever your build process requires
  - ./build.sh
  - ./test.sh
  - grep "Test Results" build.log
{% endhighlight %}

### NuGet

By default, Travis will run `nuget restore solution-name.sln` in the `install` step, which restores all NuGet packages from your solution file.
To override this (e.g. if you want to install additional packages), you can set the `install` attribute like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: csharp
solution: solution-name.sln
install:
  - sudo apt-get install -y gtk-sharp2
  - nuget restore solution-name.sln
{% endhighlight %}

### Running unit tests (NUnit, xunit, etc.)

To run your unit test suite, you'll need to install a test runner first. The recommended approach is to install it from NuGet, as this also works on the [container-based](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/workers/container-based-infrastructure/) Travis infrastructure (i.e. it doesn't need `sudo`).

The following examples show how you'd override `install` and `script` to install a test runner and pass your test assemblies to it for running the tests. 

#### NUnit

{% highlight yaml %}
language: csharp
solution: solution-name.sln
install:
  - nuget restore solution-name.sln
  - nuget install NUnit.Runners -Version 2.6.4 -OutputDirectory testrunner
script:
  - xbuild /p:Configuration=Release solution-name.sln
  - mono ./testrunner/NUnit.Runners.2.6.4/tools/nunit-console.exe ./MyPoject.Tests/bin/Release/MyProject.Tests.dll
{% endhighlight %}

#### xunit

{% highlight yaml %}
language: csharp
solution: solution-name.sln
install:
  - nuget restore solution-name.sln
  - nuget install xunit.runners -Version 1.9.2 -OutputDirectory testrunner
script:
  - xbuild /p:Configuration=Release solution-name.sln
  - mono ./testrunner/xunit.runners.1.9.2/tools/xunit.console.exe ./MyPoject.Tests/bin/Release/MyProject.Tests.dll
{% endhighlight %}

#### Other test frameworks

If you're using other test frameworks the process is similar. Please note that the MSTest framework is not supported, as it only works on Windows/Visual Studio.
